### Group

Group is the market.

Every group has its own currency.

Currencies are not interchangable among different groups.

### Member

Members are individuals who participate in the market (group).

Each member has his/her own account (balance of currency).

Typically it causes some amount of currency moved from one member (A) to another (B). It happens with a reason which we call "note".
